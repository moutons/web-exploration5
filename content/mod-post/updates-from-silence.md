Hello Infinite Universes,

It's been a little bit since I have been posting. There is still a lot of games going on, all the more than before even. However I've been finding posting game recaps like I have been before has been extremely time consuming now that I am running three concurrent games and am a player in another.

I have however gotten the theme updated to something I like a bit more and is a lot easier for me to customize.

Hopefully the recaps will resume soon, if not in a shorter, more abbreviated form to save time for me and all my players.
